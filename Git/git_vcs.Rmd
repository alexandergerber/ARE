## What is Git?

- Git is an extremly popular version control system. 
- A version control system keeps track of changes to your project and stores all versions in a data base. 
<br>
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/git1.PNG"))
```

---
## What is Git?

- Git allows to move back to previous versions of your project, if necessary. 
- You could achieve something similar by making copies of your project at specific stages:
<br>
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/git2.PNG"))
```

Why you should use Git instead of such a simple folder structure?

- Git can tell you what changed in each version.
- Git helps to synchronise different variants of a version. 
- Git makes collaborating very save since it reduces the risk of overwriting when synchronising with others and helps to solve conflicts (you might know the problem from e.g. Dropbox).
- Git reminds you to document your changes so that others and your future you know why you did something.   

---
## Where can I get help? 

On the Git hompage ([Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)) you find
- a comprehensive Documentation.
- the well written book *Pro Git*, which served as the main source of the slides.
- tutorial videos. 

---
## First Steps 

Before we can use Git we need to install it:
- look for current releases on https://git-scm.com/downloads. <br>  
--
- To check if Git was successfully installed open the terminal and run the command `git --version`.
    ```terminal
$ git --version
git version 2.11.0.windows.1
    ```
--
- After ensuring Git is working you may set your user name and email address.
    ```terminal
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```
  You need to do this once on each computer you want to work on. 

---
## Setup a Git Repository 

There are two ways to start a Git repository: 

1. Turn a directory on your PC into a Git repository. 
2. `clone` an existing repository. 

We start by creating a Git repository from scratch:

- Create a new directory e.g. on Windows `C:\myProject`. 
- Use your terminal to navigate to that directory.
```terminal
c:
cd myProject
```
- Initialize a new Git repository in this folder.
```terminal
git init
```

---
## Setup a Git Repository 

- `git init` creates a new subdirectory named `.git` that contains all repository files.

- Git dosen't automatically track changes to files in the repository. We have to tell Git if we want to save (`commit`) a new status. 

- Before we can `commit` anything we need to create some files e.g. `HelloGit.txt` file with the content. 
```
Hello World!
How are you?
```

---
## `git status`

`git status` is the first Git command you will constantly use. 
It gives you a short overview about what changed since your last
`commit`.


```terminal
C:\myProject>git status

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        HelloGit.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
 

The nice thing about `git status` is that it tells you what to do next to 
commit changes to the Git repository. 

---
## `git add`

The first step to commit changes to the repository is to  use `git add <files_to_add>`. 

```terminal
git add HelloGit.txt
```
If we run again `git status` we see 

```terminal
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   HelloGit.txt
```
The listed files (in our case there is only one) are ready to be commited. 
The files are now in the so called **staging area**.

---
## `git commit`

With the basic command `git commit` all files in the **staging area** are commited to the Git repository. There are some things to note: 
- Git wants you to document your commit by writing a so called commit message.
- Running `git commit` in the terminal will by default open the hardcore text editor VIM.  

    ```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/git3.PNG"))
    ```

- If you don't want to spend time on learning VIM in order to write commit messages you best change the default editor. On windows you might switch to 
Notepad. 
```terminal
git config --global core.editor notepad
```
---
## Commit Message

- The first line of what you type in the editor should have less than 50 characters. It is used as the title of the commit.

- After a blank line you can give a more thorough description of what you have done. 

- If you don't want to give a long description than you can also use 
    ```terminal
git commit - m "A short commit message"
    ```
    to commit the files in the staging area without opening an editor.  

- In our example, for the first commit we could do something like 
    ```terminal
git commit - m "initial commit"
    ```

## The lifecycle of the status of your files
<br>

.center[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/git5.PNG"))
```

]
---
## Exercises

1. Change the `HelloGit.txt` by replacing `Hello World!` with `Hello Git!`
2. Add the changed file to the staging area. 
3. Commit your changes to the repository. 

---
## `git log`

- The command `git log` returns the commit history of your project. We see by whom and when a commit was made together with a short commit message. 
- Each commit has a SHA value which is a unique identifier. 

```terminal
C:\MyProject>git log
commit dfc8e86ac16116ed574884d171769b6e0e35c2f9
Author: Gerber <alexander.gerber@wiwinf.uni-due.de>
Date:   Mon Sep 23 15:26:58 2019 +0200

    Welcome Git with Hello Git!

commit 2f17088a3831efd6870ffc8ca54c93df6b39035d
Author: Gerber <alexander.gerber@wiwinf.uni-due.de>
Date:   Mon Sep 23 15:02:02 2019 +0200

    Initial commit!
```

Learn more about `git log` [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History).

---
## `git diff`

- With `git diff` we can compare files before and after a commit. 

    Suppose we want to know what exactly changed in our last commit. For this we have to compare to the first commit:

    ```terminal
    C:\MyProject>git diff 2f17..dfc8
    
    diff --git a/HelloGit.txt b/HelloGit.txt
    index 4f6866b..71e6eca 100644
    --- a/HelloGit.txt
    +++ b/HelloGit.txt
    @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
    -Hello World!
    +Hello Git!
    ```
- Note that we don't need the full SHA. It is usually enough to provide the first 4 signs. If it would happen that 2 or more SHA values started with the same 4 signs then Git would tell us to provide more signs until the result gets unambiguous.  

---
## `git diff`

Modify the `HelloGit.txt` file again. If you now run 

```terminal
git diff
```
all unstaged (everything that is not added yet) changes since the last commit are listed. 

---
## `git rm`

- Use `git rm` to remove files from Git. The command does 2 things: 
    - deletes the file from your working directory
    - removes the file from your tracked files. 

- After using `git rm` you have to commit the removal by doing a standard commit. 

    ```terminal
git rm HelloGit.txt
git commit -m "remove HelloGit.txt"
    ```
- If you only want to remove a file from the tracked files but keep it in your working directory run 

    ```terminal
    git rm --cached HelloGit.txt
    ```


---
## `git checkout`

- Consider the following commit history: 

    ```terminal 
    C:\MyProject>git log --pretty=oneline
    
    332fa3c6ea743a8d9ac34f3c5db94ed6c9e9ed20 add important file
    c3ed28cbdf6f7419242ad0747806d309954211f9 important change
    5d3eb1b76baf5921b0b8babc2ba7c3fffb82666a added newFile.txt
    86214741766959936c09b1ecaf213dd6d749ef60 deleted HelloGit.txt
    27d048c3bebda441db44b9506080b4784dcc728b initial commit
    ```

- Lets say you regret deleting `HelloGit.txt` and you want it back. 
With the command `git checkout <SHA><path>` files can be brought back to their state of the specified commit. 

    ```terminal
git checkout 27d048 newFile.txt
    ```

---
## `git reset`

- If you want the whole project back at the state of a previous commit you can do

  ```terminal
  git reset --hard 27d048 
  ```
- However, all changes after that commit will be discarded. 

- If you want to keep changes locally (in the directory on your computer) use 

  ```terminal
  git reset 27d048 
  ```
- After running this you can decide which changes after commit `27d048` you want to keep or discard since they 
are now all in the modified files stage. 

---
## Exercises
1. Make some changes to `HelloGit.txt` in your repository and add it to the staging area. 
2. Assume that you forgot some important changes and you want to unstage `HelloGit.txt`. For this, first remove `HelloGit.txt` from the staging area (`git status` will help you). Then make some changes and commit them. 
3. Restore the initial state of the `HelloGit.txt` file (i.e. the state after the initial commit).  
4. Create a new text file with arbitrary content. Add and commit your changes. 
5. Remove the text file but do not commit. 
6. Try to restore the text file. 

---
## Remote Repository

- Until now our repository only lives on our local machine. In order to collaborate with others we need too use a remote repository which everybody can access.

- [Github](https://github.com) is platform where one can host remote repositories for free. 

Setup a remote repository: 

1. Go to Github.com and create a new account.
2. Login to your Github account and go to + &rarr; New repository.

    ```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/git4.PNG"))
    ```

---
## Remote Repository
3. Give your repository a name and click `Create repository`.
4. Copy and paste the lines below ***"…or push an existing repository from the command line"*** in the terminal of your local project to connect it with the repository on Github. For me this is 
```terminal
git remote add origin https://github.com/alexandergerber/test.git
git push -u origin master
```
5. Provide your Github username and password. 
6. Take a look at the repository on Github. What do you find? 

---
## `git push`

Every `commit` changes the Git repository on your local machine. If you want to update 
the remote repository on Github you also need to `push` your local commits. 

Add a new file to your repository. Then add, commit and push the new file.   

```terminal 
C:\myProject>git push
```

---
## Collaborate

Find somebody in the classroom to collaborate with.  
<br>

--
One adds the other to his Github repository.
- Settings &rarr; Collaborators  

--

The one who was added to the repository clones the repository to his local machine: 
1. Use the terminal to navigate to the folder where you want to have the repository. 
2. Use `git clone` like below (change the repository url to that of your collaborator). 

    ```terminal 
    git clone https://github.com/alexandergerber/HelloGit.git
    ```

--
    Now the both of you can work on the same project. 

---
## `git fetch` and `git merge`

- If more than one person work on a project it will happen that you are locally behind the remote repository. 

- To update your local repository to the current status of the remote: 
    1. Download everything that happened since you last synchronised with the remote repository using `git fetch`. 
    2. Merge the new changes to your repository with `git merge`. 

    This should run smoothly if you didn't work on the project in the meantime. 

---
## Exercise

1. One makes a change to the shared repository (add, commit, push). Afterwards the other one fetches the changes, runs `git status`
(inspect the result) and merges the changes into his repository. Then do the same thing the other way around. 

---
## Solving conflicts

- The original `HelloGit.txt` file looked like this:

    ```terminal
    Hello Git
    How are you?
    ```
- Two other people working on the same project didn't like this and changed it independently from each other. 

    Change of Person A
    
    ```terminal
    Hello Git,
    
    How are you? I think I should work on this file.  
    ```
    Change of Person B
    
    ```terminal
    Hello Git!
    How are you? I hope you don't run into too many conflicts. 
    ```

---
## Solving conflicts

- Person B pushed her changes first to the remote server. There was no problem because she worked with the most recent commit. 

- However, Person A is now behind by one commit. If she tries to push a new commit, Git will tell her that 
she first needs to `git pull` which is short for `git fetch` and `git merge`.  

- If Person A does this, Git will try to solve the confilict automatically. 
However, in this example case Git won't be able to do so because the exact same parts of the file were changed and we don't want a machine to decide what to keep and what to discard. 😀

    ```terminal
    C:\Users\AlexanderGerber\myProject>git merge
    Auto-merging HelloGit.txt
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in HelloGit.txt
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
    ```
---
## Solving conflicts

- Instead of solving the conflict, Git will parepare the file in a way that makes it easy for you to solve the conflict yourself. Look for sections starting with`<<<<<<< HEAD` and ending with `>>>>>>> refs/...`. 

    ```terminal
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    Hello Git,
    
    How are you? I think I shoudld work on this file.  
    =======
    Hello Git!
    How are you? I hope you don't run into too many conflicts. 
    >>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master
    ```
- Decide what to keep and then remove everything Git included for helping you to solve the conflict. 
- The final results can be commited and pushed to the remote repository.  

---
## Exercise
1. Produce a merge confilict in your project. Then solve it.   


---
## .gitignore

- Not everything in our working directory should be tracked by Git. 
- A a rule of thumb is to track source files only (e.g. only the `.rmd` but not the generated `.html` file).
- Git ignores all files which are specified in the file `.gitignore`.
- Since it would be cumbersome to list individually list each file that shouldn't be tracked Git allows the usage of patterns.
- Learn more about it in the (gitignore documentation)[https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore].

#### Example `.gitignore` file
```terminal
 .Rhistory
 *.html
 Packages/example/
```



---
## Branching

- There is a pretty important concept which we didn't cover at all named **branching**.

- It allows you to diverge form the linear development of your project to having multiple parallel versions at the same time. 

- If you want to dig deeper into Git this would be one of the key features you should learn about after you digested the basics discussed so far (which should be enough for this course).
