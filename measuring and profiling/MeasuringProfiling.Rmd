### Measuring Performance

#### *Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.*

#### — Donald Knuth (famous american computer scientist) .

---
## Prerequisites

Before trying to make code run faster it is necessary to understand what is making it slow. `r emo::ji('snail')`


**Profiling** means measuring run time of our code line-by-line using realistic inputs in order to identify *bottlenecks*.

After identifying bottlenecks we experiment with equivalent alternatives of code and find the fastest using a **microbenchmark**.

We will use the packages `profvis` and `bench` for profiling and benchmarking. Please make sure they are installed by checking whether the following code chunk executes without issues.

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
library(profvis)
library(bench)
```

### Profiling

#### *It’s tempting to think you just know where the bottlenecks in your code are. I mean, after all, you write it! But trust me, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been surprised at where exactly my code is spending all its time. The reality is that profiling is better than guessing.*

#### — Roger D. Peng

### Profiling - `utils::Rprof()`

`Rprof()` is a build-in *sampling profiler*. It keeps track of the *function call stack* at regularly sampled intervals.

- The function call stack is a record of the function currently executing, the function that called the function, and so on (from right to left)

- The default time interval between sampling is 0.02 seconds. If the profiled code executes faster you need to pass an appropriate sampling time to the argument `interval`.

- The output of `Rprof()` is a complete listing of the function call stack at every sampling iteration (which, on its own, is often not very informative) which is printed to a binary file in the current working directory

- Note: results are *stochastic* &mdash; we never run a function twice under the same conditions (memory usage, CPU load etc.) 

---
### `utils::Rprof()`

**Example: profiling a call of `replicate()`**

```{r, eval = F, cache=TRUE}
tmp <- tempfile()

Rprof(tmp, interval = 0.1)       # start the profiler
replicate(5, mean(rnorm(1e6)))
Rprof(NULL)                      # stop profiling

writeLines(readLines(tmp))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat('
sample.interval=100000
"rnorm" "mean" "FUN" "lapply" "sapply" "replicate" 
"rnorm" "mean" "FUN" "lapply" "sapply" "replicate" 
"rnorm" "mean" "FUN" "lapply" "sapply" "replicate" 
')
```

So `rnorm()` is six levels deep in the call stack and it seems that R spends most of time evaluating `rnorm(1e6)` and the code takes ~ 0.3 seconds to run.

---
### `utils::Rprof()`

A more useful output is produced by `utils::summaryRprof()`. 

By appending `$by.total` we get the time spend in each function by the total run time. 

**Example: Profiling a call of `replicate()`**

```{r, eval=F}
summaryRprof(tmp)$by.total
```

```{r, echo = F}
cat('
             total.time total.pct self.time self.pct
"rnorm"            0.3       100       0.3      100
"FUN"              0.3       100       0.0        0
"lapply"           0.3       100       0.0        0
"mean"             0.3       100       0.0        0
"replicate"        0.3       100       0.0        0
"sapply"           0.3       100       0.0        0
')
```

---
### `utils::Rprof()`

By appending `$by.self` the results are adjusted for the time to run functions above the current function in the call stack.

**Example: profiling a call of `replicate()`**
```{r, eval=F}
summaryRprof(tmp)$by.self
```
```{r, echo = F}
cat('
       self.time self.pct total.time total.pct
"rnorm"       0.3      100        0.3       100
')
```

As expected, the random number generation takes approx. 100% of the total computation time.

---
### Visualising profiles: `profvis::profvis()`

**Example: profiling nested functions**

```{r}
# define some nested example functions
f <- function() {
  pause(0.1)
  g()
  h()
}

g <- function() {
  pause(0.1)
  h()
}

h <- function() {
  pause(0.1)
}
```

(We use `profvis::pause()` because the time spend in `base::sys.sleep()` is not measured as computing time.)

---
### Visualising profiles: `profvis::profvis()`
**Example: profiling nested functions**

Visualisation using `profvis()` works best when the code is sourced from an .R-script

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# source f(), g(), h() form R script
source("codes/profiling-example.R")

# visualise profiling results
profvis(f())
```

After profiling, `profvis()` opens an interactive HTML window will *RStudio* which lets you explore the results.

The interface provided by `profvis()` connects the profiling data back to the source code. This makes it easier to build up a 'mental' model of what you need to change.

### Visualising profiles: `profvis::profvis()`

The top pane 

- displays bar plots of running times and memory allocations with the latter being no issue here (why?)

- provides a good overall feel for bottlenecks but is quite imprecise about the *cause*

`h()` is not significantly slower than `g()`: `h()` is reported to take 150 ms (twice as long as `g()`) because it is called two times.


The bottom pane shows a *flame graph* of the full call stack. The full sequence confirms that

 - `h()` is called from two different places (once by `g()` and once by `f()`)

 - the execution time of `h()` is roughly the same in each call.
 
Mousing over a cell in the function stack indicates the corresponding line in the source code.

    x = rnorm(5e4),
    y = rnorm(5e4)
  )

  plot(x ~ y, data = dat)
  m <- lm(x ~ y, data = dat)
  abline(m, col = "red")

})

### Memory Profiling

**Example: extensive garbage collection**

The following code generates a large number of short-lived objects by *copy-on-modify*.

```{r, eval=F}
profvis({
  
  x <- integer()
  
  for (i in 1:1e4) {
    x <- c(x, i)
  }
  
})
```

### Memory Profiling

It looks like R spends most of the time modifying the data in-place, but that’s not actually what’s happening internally.

---
### Memory Profiling

What is going on?

- The memory column indicates that large amounts of memory are being allocated (right bar) and freed (left bar)

  Reasons: 
  
  1. A new memory object is generated by modifying a copy of the 'old' `x` which is then reassigned to `x` in each iteration
  
  2. Garbage collection (GC) automatically frees memory by deleting no more required objects

- While `c()` runs for a total of 170 ms, a considerable amount of this time is due to garbage collection (`<GC>`)

When you see the garbage collector taking up a lot of time, you can often come up with a more efficient alternative.

---
### Memory Profiling

Sometimes code statements seem fairly innocent but are very inefficient both when it comes to memory and speed.

**Example: coercion to another type**

```{r, eval=F, }
profvis({
  x <- matrix(nrow = 1e4, ncol = 1e4)
  x[1, 1] <- 0
  x[1:3, 1:3] 
})
```

### Memory Profiling
**Example: coercion to another type**

Can you explain why execution of the third line needs 762.9MB memory?

---
### Memory Profiling
**Example: coercion to another type**
```{r, cache=T}
p <- profmem::profmem({
  x <- matrix(nrow = 1e4, ncol = 1e4)
  x[1, 1] <- 0
  x[1:3, 1:3]  
})

print(p, expr = F)
```

---
### Memory Profiling

**Example: coercion to another type**

What is going on?

The code seems fairly innocent, but it turns out that it is very inefficient - both when it comes to memory and speed:

- `x` is initialized with type `logical` (it is filled with `NA`s) and thus cannot contain numeric values.

- `x[1, 1] <- 0` internally coerces `x` to a `numeric` matrix before assigning `0` to the (1,1) element which is quite costly: initializing `x` was more than twice as fast!

Especially if a large number of computations need to be performed, coercion should be avoided wherever possible!

---
### Profiling &mdash; some notes and hints

- C/C++ (or other compiled) code cannot be profiled

- We also cannot profile what happens *inside* primitive functions, e.g., `sum()` and `sqrt()` (these functions are written in C or FORTRAN).

  We thus cannot use profiling to see whether the code is slow due because something further down the call stack is slow.
  
**Example: primitive functions**
  
```{r, eval=F}
profvis({
  sqrt(sum(abs(rnorm(sum(1e6)))))
  })
```

- Profiling is just another reason to **break your code into functions** so that the profiler can give useful information about where time is being spent

# Microbenchmarking

---
### What is a Microbenchmark?

*A microbenchmark is a program designed to test a very small snippets of code for a specific task. Microbenchmarks are always artificial and they are not intended to represent normal use.*

- We usually speak of milliseconds (ms), microseconds (µs), or nanoseconds (ns) here. 

- Important: microbenchmarks can rarely be generalised to 'real' code: the observed differences in microbenchmarks will typically be dominated by **higher-order effects** in real code.

  Think of it this way:
  
  A deep understanding of quantum physics is not very helpful when baking cookies.
  
- There are several R packages for microbenchmarking. We will rely on the `bench` package by Hester (2018) which currently has the most accurate timer function.

---
### Microbenchmarking &mdash; the `bench` package

- `bench` is part of the `tidyerse`. It uses the highest precision APIs available for the common operating system (often nanoseconds-level!)

- `mark()` is the working horse of the `bench` package and measures both memory allocation and computation time.

- By default, a human-readable statistical summary on the distributions of memory load and timings based on 1e4 iterations is returned which also reports on garbage collections

- Benchmarking across a grid of input values with `bench::press()` is possible

- The package also has methods for neat visualization of the results using `ggplot2::autoplot()` (default plot type is [beeswarm](https://flowingdata.com/2016/09/08/beeswarm-plot-in-r-to-show-distributions/)) 

---
### Microbenchmarking &mdash; `bench::mark()`

**Example: "the fastest square root"**

```{r, eval=1:5}
x <- runif(100)
(lb <- bench::mark(
  sqrt(x),
  x ^ 0.5
))

```

```{r, eval=F, warning=F, message=F}
plot(lb)
```

---
### Microbenchmarking &mdash; `bench::mark()`

**Example: "the fastest square root"**

```{r, echo=F, fig.width=14, fig.height=8.5}
plot(lb)
```

---
### Microbenchmarking &mdash; `bench::mark()`

**Example: non-equivalent code**

```{r, eval=F}
set.seed(42)

dat <- data.frame(
  x = runif(10000, 1, 1000),
  y = runif(10000, 1, 1000))

bench::mark(
  dat[dat$x > 500, ],
  dat[which(dat$x > 499), ],
  subset(dat, x > 500))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat('
Error: Each result must equal the first result:
  `dat$x > 500` does not equal `which(dat$x > 499)` Each result must 
  equal the first result:
  `` does not equal ``
    ')
```

Use `check = FALSE` to disable checking of consistent results.

---
### Microbenchmarking &mdash; `bench::mark()`

**Example: benchmark against parameter grid**

```{r, results='hide', cache=T}
set.seed(42)

create_df <- function(rows, cols) {
  as.data.frame(setNames(
    replicate(cols, runif(rows, 1, 1000), simplify = FALSE),
    rep_len(c("x", letters), cols)))
}

results <- bench::press(
  rows = c(10000, 100000),
  cols = c(10, 100),
  {
    dat <- create_df(rows, cols)
    bench::mark(
      min_iterations = 100,
      bracket = dat[dat$x > 500, ],
      which = dat[which(dat$x > 500), ],
      subset = subset(dat, x > 500)
    )
  }
)

---
### Microbenchmarking &mdash; Exercises

1. Instead of using `bench::mark()`, you could use the built-in function `system.time()` which is, however, much less precise, so you’ll need to repeat each operation many times with a loop, and then divide to find the average time of each operation, as in the code below.
    
    ```
    n <- 1e6
    system.time(for (i in 1:n) sqrt(x)) / n
    system.time(for (i in 1:n) x ^ 0.5) / n
    ```

  How do the estimates from `system.time()` compare to those from `bench::mark()`? Why are they different?

2. Here are two other ways to compute the square root of a vector. Which do you think will be fastest? Which will be slowest? Use microbenchmarking to test your answers.

    ```
    x ^ (1 / 2)
    exp(log(x) / 2)
    ```

### (Why) is R slow?

### (Why) is R slow?

Think of R as both the definition of a language and its implementation.

**`R` language**

- The R language defines meaning of code statements and how they work (*very abstract*) 

- R is an extremely dynamic language, i.e., you have *a lot* freedom in modifying objects after they have been created

- This dynamism is comfortable because is allows you to iterate your code and alter objects &mdash; there's no need to start from scratch when something doesn't work out!

`r emo::ji('lightning')` Changes for improving speed without breaking existing code are problematic. 

---
### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Slow Code Interpretation

... but:

`R` is an interpreted language. Its dynamism causes code interpretation to be relatively time consuming.

**Example**

```{r, echo=TRUE, rx =T}
x <- 0L
for (i in 1:1e6) {
  x <- x + 1
}
```

In the above example, the interpreter cannot predict that the loop always adds `1` to an integer `x`. `R` needs to look for the right `+` method (the method for adding two doubles) in *every* iteration of the loop!

---
### (Why) is R slow?

**Implementation**

- Processes R code and computes results; commonly base R (*GNU-R*) from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/)

- R (written in *FORTRAN*, *R*, and *C*) is more than 20 years old was not indented for super fast computations

- `r emo::ji('bolt')` tweaking for speed improvements is easier (done by R-core team) but not feasible for end users like us. <br><br> Some alternatives address specific issues:

  - "pretty quick R" [pqR](http://www.pqr-project.org/) (parallelisation of core functions)
  
  - [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open) (some fast extensions for machine learning)


---
### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Name Look-up with Mutable Environments

**Lexical Scoping in a Nutshell:**

*"Values of variables are searched for in the environment the function belongs to."*


- If a value is not found in the environment in which a function was defined, search steps-up to the *parent environment*

- This continues down the sequence of parent environments until the top-level environment (usually the *global environment* or a package namespace) is reached

- After the top-level environment, the search continues down the *search list* until we hit the *empty environment*.

---
### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Name Look-up with Mutable Environments

**Example: have you seen z?**

Interpreter asks: which environment does the value of `z` come from?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
f <- function(x, y) {
  x + y / z
}
```

```{r}
# print search list
search()
```

---
### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Name Look-up with Mutable Environments

**Example: have you seen z?**

Interpreter asks: which environment does the value of `z` come from?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
z <- 1                 # global environment

f <- function() {      # f() is parent to g()
  print(z)
  g <- function() {
    z <- 3
    print(z)
  }
  z <- 2
  print(z)
  g() 
}
f()
```

Name look-up is done every time we call `print(z)`!

---
### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Look-up with Mutable Environments

Even more problematic: most operations are lexically scoped function calls. This includes `+` and `-` but also (sometimes "recklessly" used) *operators* like `(` and `{`.

**Example: excessive usage of parenthesis.**

(a first example of poorly written code)

```{r, cache=T}
g <- function(x) x = (1/(1 + x))
h <- function(x) x = ((1/(1 + x)))
i <- function(x) x = (((1/(1 + x))))

x <- sample(1:100, 100, replace = TRUE)

bench::mark(g(x), h(x), i(x))
```

---
### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Look-up with Mutable Environments

**Example: function calls in nested environments**


```{r, cache=T}
f <- function(x, y) {
  (x + y) ^ 2
}

### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Look-up with Mutable Environments

**Example: function calls in nested environments &mdash; ctd.**

```{r, warning=F, message=F, cache=T}
bench::mark(f(1, 2), f2(1, 2), f3(1, 2), f4(1, 2))
```

Each additional environment between `f()` and the global environment where `+` and `^` are defined increases computation time.

### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Lazy Evaluation Overhead

R function arguments are lazy --- they are only evaluated when actually needed. An unevaluated argument is called *promise* and consists of

  1. an expression
    
  2. a corresponding environment
    
  3. a value (if the expression was evaluated)

**Example: lazy evaluation**

```{r, eval=F}
f1 <- function(a) {force(a); NULL} # why not simply write 'a'?
f1(stop("My dog speaks Chinese"))
```

vs.

```{r, eval=F}
f1 <- function(a) NULL
f1(stop("My dog speaks Chinese"))
```

### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Lazy Evaluation Overhead

Promises are very convenient but should be avoided if speed is crucial.

**Example: lazy evaluation**

```{r}
f1 <- function(a) NULL
f2 <- function(a = 1, b = 2, c = 4, d = 4, e = 5) NULL
bench::mark(f1(), f2())
```

Arguments trigger promises each time the function is *called*. Superfluous arguments thus lead to avoidable overhead.

### (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Summary

- R is not slow *per se* &mdash; but it is slow compared to other languages:

    Speed isn't its strongest suit but accessability and compatibility are. R was designed to make life easier for you, not for your computer!

    More technically: R is an easy-to-use high level programming language. It provides a flexible and extensible toolkit for data analysis and statistics.

- We are (mostly) happy to accept the slower speed for the time saved from not having to reinvent the wheel each time we want to implement a new function that, e.g., computes a test statistic.

    (meanwhile there are `r nrow(available.packages(repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"))` packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with many useful functions waiting to be discovered by you!)

- We cannot overcome the circumstances described in this section. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when you want to write high performance code. We'll discuss these in the next chapter.
